		We are always looking for talented and highly motivated students and researchers at all levels to join the 
		<strong>Kang Lab (starting in January 2026)</strong> in the School of Electrical Engineering at KAIST.

	<p class="note">
		<strong>Kang Lab</strong> is an alias of the <em>Intelligent Imaging Systems Lab</em>. Our group focuses on developing intelligent imaging systems that unify physical and mathematical principles 
		(in their fundamental, first-principles forms), computation (e.g., machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)), and system-level design. 
		We build integrated hardware–software pipelines (or so-called <em>middleware</em>) that make advanced imaging more accessible, scalable, and reliable across scientific and engineering applications.
	</p>

	<p>
		This research direction is meaningful in several important ways: 
		(1) rather than treating computation purely as post-processing, we aim to intelligently and adaptively control imaging systems, 
		fundamentally improving signal and image quality at the <em>upstream</em> stage (an approach that is particularly well suited for edge applications, where computing resources may be comparatively limited); 
		(2) by rigorously embedding physical principles into computation, we seek to develop ML/AI models that are more physically grounded and practically deployable in scientific laboratories and industrial environments; and 
		(3) by actively collaborating with diverse application domains, we aim to catalyze new scientific discoveries and industrial efficiency, to pursue what we see as the true value of interdisciplinary research.
	</p>

	<p>
		Our work initially focuses on unlocking the potential and capabilities of optical imaging systems such as holography and microscopy; 
		however, as reflected in the lab's name, we aim to expand this research philosophy to imaging systems more broadly, including medical imaging, semiconductor inspection, and beyond.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you believe you are aligned with our group's direction and philosophy, please follow the instructions below and send the requested materials to 
		<span class="email">iksung.kang@alum.mit.edu</span>. Due to the high volume of emails, I may not be able to respond to every message. 
		We welcome applicants with strong backgrounds (or strong interests) in one or more of the following areas: 
		computational imaging, optics, machine learning, signal processing, inverse problems, and scientific computing.
