    <p class="note">
      <strong>Kang Lab</strong> is an alias of the <em>Intelligent Imaging Systems Lab</em>. Our group focuses on developing intelligent imaging systems that unify physical and mathematical principles
      (in their fundamental, first-principles forms), computation (e.g., machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)), and system-level design.
      We build integrated hardware–software pipelines (or <em>middleware</em>) that make advanced imaging more accessible, scalable, and reliable across scientific and engineering applications.

  <td class="text-pad">
    <p>This research direction is meaningful in several important ways:</p>
    <ol class="research-points">
      <li>
        Rather than treating computation purely as post-processing, we aim to intelligently and adaptively control imaging systems, fundamentally improving signal and image quality at the
        <em>upstream</em> stage (which is particularly well-suited for edge applications, where computing resources may be comparatively limited.)
      </li>
      <li>
        By rigorously embedding physical principles into computation, we seek to develop ML/AI models that are more physically grounded and practically deployable in scientific laboratories and industrial environments.
      </li>
      <li>
        By actively collaborating with diverse application domains, we aim to catalyze new scientific discoveries and industrial efficiency, pursuing what we see as the true value of interdisciplinary research.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Our work initially focuses on unlocking the potential and novel capabilities of computational optical imaging systems in the contexts of microscopy, tomography, and holography;
      however, as reflected in the lab’s name, we aim to extend this research philosophy to imaging systems more broadly, including medical imaging, semiconductor inspection, and beyond.
